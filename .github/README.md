# Audio Web Components

This is just an exploration of pairing the Web Audio API with Web
Components. The initial goal is to create Web Components for each type
of `AudioNode`. Nesting elements within each other will connect them.

Eventually, Iâ€™d love to experiment with the following:

- Use the Drag and Drop API.
- Use the Canvas API to create visualizers.
